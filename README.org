* Quotes

#+begin_quote
I should keep a list of quotes I come up with. They could randomly appear during
use of /Adna/, so that I may contemplate them.
#+end_quote

This repository houses both the quotes Sqlite3 database and the source code for a
program to interface with it. That program is written in Common Lisp, and can be
used to generate an executable with the Makefile: ~make quotes~.
