* Quotes

#+begin_quote
I should keep a list of quotes I come up with. They could randomly appear during
use of /Adna/, so that I may contemplate them.
#+end_quote

This repository houses both the quotes Sqlite3 database and the source code for a
program to interface with it. That program is written in Common Lisp, and can be
used to generate an executable with the Makefile: ~make quotes~.

If you want to run this as a script, you'll need to do a few things, like (untested):
#+begin_src lisp
  (load "~/.sbclrc")
  (ql:quickload "clingon" :silent t)
  (ql:quickload "sqlite" :silent t)
#+end_src
at the top and explicitly call ~(main)~ at the bottom.

When starting an interactive REPL session, this may help load this system:
#+begin_src lisp
  (push "PATH/TO/REPO/" asdf:*central-registry*)
#+end_src
Note the trailing '/' in the path.
